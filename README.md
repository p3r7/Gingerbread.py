# Affinity2KiCAD

*Affinity2KiCAD* is a set of Python utilities used by [Winterbloom](https://winterbloom.com) to create decorative PCBs from SVGs exported from [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/).

**NOTE**: This tool is *extremely* tailored to Winterbloom's needs. It's not perfect, it's not universal, and it almost certainly won't work for you without modification. **We won't be providing any support for this.** That said, you're welcome to try it out, learn from it, take code from it, and give us feedback or even contribute if you'd like.

## Contributing

Because this tool is so specifically tailored to Winterbloom's workflow, contributions aren't generally expected. However, if you'd like to contribute please file an issue or reach out to us before you write code, so we can make sure it's something that'll be beneficial for all of us. :)
